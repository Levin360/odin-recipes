    <!-- Description HERE -->
    <p>The mild sweetness of coconut milk brings a sense of delight to the sharp notes of

        Not only does it contain a generous amount of meat in some succulent, juicy pork 
        belly, but it is also enriched by a local favorite to season and bring some unique 
        flavor to the dishâ€“ shrimp paste or bagoong.</p>
