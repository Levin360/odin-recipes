            <div class="steps-list">
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine pork, soy sauce, whole peppercorn, and garlic in a bowl. Mix well. Cover the bowl with a clear plastic wrap. Place inside the refrigerator and marinate for at least 3 hours.</li>
                    <li>Heat a pan on a stovetop. Once the pan is hot enough, pour the marinated pork along with the marinade. Cook until the pork browns.</li>
                    <li>Pour beef broth into the pan. Let boil.</li>
                    <li>Add the ghost pepper and Thai chilies. Cover the pan and continue to cook in medium heat for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add bay leaves and vinegar. Let the liquid boil. Stir and then cover the pan. Continue to cook for 40 to 60 minutes or until the pork becomes tender. Note: you can add more broth or water if the liquid starts to dry while the pork is not that tender enough.</li>
                    <li>Remove the cover from the pan. Continue to cook until the liquid totally evaporates. Cook a little bit longer in low to medium heat until oil gets extracted from the pork.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to a serving plate. Serve for pulutan or as a main dish with warm rice.</li>
                    <li>Share and enjoy!</li>
