    <!-- Description HERE -->
     <p>Have you ever tried braising your pork belly in heaps of tasty pineapple juice? If 
        your answer is no, it’s time to add this Pork Hamonado recipe to your meal list for 
        the week. This is a must-try Pinoy dish that marries the savor of crushed garlic and 
        soy sauce with the perfect sugary quality of pineapple. The chunks of this tropical 
        fruit also make your pork stew more exciting and tasty.  This is a dish that can work 
        for any time of the day, but I’d say it is best to have for lunch with plenty of rice 
        on the side. </p>

    <!-- Cooking Steps HERE -->
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>First, we need our cooking oil to be hot. Pour this all over your cooking pot, 
            and then apply heat. Once the oil is hot, you can place your pork belly inside. 
            Fry this for 2 minutes, and then turn the meat over. Cook the other side for the 
            same amount of time.</li>
        <li>We will now utilize our soy sauce, pineapple juice, half of the pineapple chunks, and water. <br>
            Put these ingredients in the pot. Then add your garlic, as well as the whole 
            peppercorn to make our dish flavorful. Place the cover on top of the pot, and 
            just wait for the mixture to start boiling.</li>
        <li>Once the liquid boils, you can reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the mixture for 
            about 60 minutes, or until the pork gets nice and tender. As you are cooking, 
            you may pour more water inside if needed so the stew does not dry up. </li>
        <li>We may now add the pineapple chunks we have left behind. Also sprinkle in your 
            brown sugar. Then integrate the salt (only if needed). For this seasoning, it’s 
            important that we also don’t go overboard so that the dish does not end up too 
            salty.</li>
        <li>We’re down to our final step! All that’s left for us to do is to keep the hamonado cooking for 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Serve while Hot and Enjoy!</li>
     </ol>
